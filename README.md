# Governed Work Runtime (gwr)

A local-first governed work runtime for exact AI-mediated repository effects.

The trusted runtime establishes mechanical facts only; domain modules own semantic
judgments; labor providers produce candidate artifacts and untrusted provenance. The
normative specification lives in `docs/governed-runtime/`.

Docket is **agent-neutral but currently Git-effect-specific**: exactly one effect class
is admitted — the atomic Git target-ref transition, `GitRefEffect` — and a proposal
outside it is refused with a typed refusal *before* any standing is issued, any
reservation is created, any dispatch identity is minted, or any provider runs
([`effect-classes.md`](docs/governed-runtime/effect-classes.md)). Recovery guarantees
are properties of that class and its stated premises, not universal Docket guarantees.

## Status

Docket is the **governed-execution office** of a four-office constellation:
Nightshift proposes bounded intent, **AG ng** authorizes the exact prepared
attempt (one-use authority burn), Docket prepares exact bytes, executes via
its broker, and settles with evidence, and **NQ** evaluates the exported
dossier against registered claims and consumer reliance. Docket owns both
authorization wire contracts (`gwr:authz-request:v1`, `ag.docket-issuance:v1`)
and their conformance vectors; it does not own authorization policy, claim
admissibility, or orchestration posture — and its own reliance bridge refuses
`safe-to-merge` as permanently inadmissible.

The audited baseline is frozen as [`gwr-greenfield-v0.1`](CHANGELOG.md) — a greenfield
comparison result, built without adapting any prior implementation. It is a working
runtime with a full audit record, not a production-hardened product. Work after the tag
(the first pilot, the canonical read surface, the explicit effect-class boundary, the
upstream-authorization intake, and two completed multi-office verticals) is on
`main` and recorded in the changelog; the tag has not moved.

Maturity: **operationally reusable vertical** — the three-office run
([`vertical-01.md`](docs/vertical-01.md), 2026-07-25) and the four-office
pilot (2026-07-26, target: the Nightshift repository; declared in Nightshift's
`docs/FOUR_OFFICE_PILOT_01.md`, itself the pilot's broker-authored governed
effect) both ran on this runtime without code changes. Not operator-ready or
production-hardened; the trust-model premises below still hold the load.

The compared prior Rust implementation, `transition-kernel`, is a **research
cousin, not a predecessor**: the Task 14 comparison
([`old-rust-comparison.md`](docs/governed-runtime/old-rust-comparison.md))
concluded "complementary organs, not rivals" and imported nothing.

**Read the trust model before relying on anything here.**
[`docs/governed-runtime/trust-model.md`](docs/governed-runtime/trust-model.md) states what
is enforced and what is assumed. Three assumptions are load-bearing and are premises rather
than guarantees: exclusive broker custody of the governed target ref, same-UID trust of the
labor provider and broker binary, and monotone clock readings. Several claims a reader
might expect to be enforced are deliberately written down there as premises instead.

Documents cite an external "normative packet" as their requirements source. That packet is
held privately and is not part of this repository; the citations are to an external source,
not to missing files.

## Install from source

Docket currently has a source installation path, not a published-package promise. From a
clean checkout, build both required executables and inspect the operator surface:

```bash
cargo build --locked --workspace
./target/debug/docket --help
test -x ./target/debug/gwr-git-broker
```

The `docket` and `gwr-git-broker` executables must remain siblings, unless
`GWR_BROKER_BIN` explicitly names the broker. Required build and runtime dependencies,
an optional `cargo install --path` flow, clean state creation, provider configuration, and
supported versus unsupported invocation paths are recorded in
[`source-install-and-bootstrap.md`](docs/governed-runtime/source-install-and-bootstrap.md).

## Workspace

- `crates/gwr-core` — pure deterministic types and transition rules. No I/O.
- `crates/gwr-runtime` — use-case coordination and neutral ports.
- `crates/gwr-local` — SQLite, filesystem artifacts, provider adapters, Git broker,
  observations, CLI, clocks, identity generation.

## Verification

Four gates, all required:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo test --workspace --release
```

Pass/fail is decided by exit codes, never by reading the tail of the output.

The release run is not redundant: a defect was shipped once whose behaviour differed
between build profiles — a `debug_assert!` panicked in debug on operator-supplied input
while release silently accepted it. Both suites must be green.

At the freeze this was 125 tests, identical in both profiles.
