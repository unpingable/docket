//! The issued campaign-stage standing instrument: content-addressed,
//! role-bound, stage-bound, basis-bound, path-bound, effect-bound, expiring,
//! consumable exactly once.
//!
//! Standing is consumed, not checked: the one consumption is durable before
//! the stage's effect runs (burn-before-effect), and a replayed consumption
//! refuses. Standing is issued only from an exact proposal — never from a
//! historical receipt — and no path widens it after issuance: a worker's
//! output cannot broaden paths, repositories, role, effect class, or window.
//! Fields are private for the same reason as `domain::standing::StandingGrant`:
//! an editable expiry is not expiry.
//!
//! Non-transferable across roles: consumption presents an execution context
//! (campaign, stage, role, proposal digest) and every divergence refuses.
